### *Description*

The study uses a mixed-methods approach that combines content analysis, qualitative examples and descriptive statistics to map where different financial mechanisms are most salient along a seafood firm development trajectory and identify three leverage points that can redirect capital towards more sustainable practices: loan covenants, stock exchange listing rules and shareholder activism. Scripts and data included in this repository focus on analyses and [network visualizations](https://jbjouffray.github.io/SeafoodFinance/networks) of more than 3000 shareholders of 160 publicly listed seafood firms.
